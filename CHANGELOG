Version 0.1 - First release of the plugin

2013-01-04
Version 0.2 - Fixed two bugs, whereas one important
		1. In case there more than one wheater alert for the specified
		   region, the script would bug out. Fixed by adding 'head -n1'
		   so that it always only shows the first warning issued.
		2. In case there were swedish characters (åäö) in the warning
		   message they would output as their HTML-equivalent. Fixed
		   with another sed substitue command.

	      in the hardcoded region/district names.
